# Using AI for Code Review and Refactoring

Code review and refactoring are essential parts of the development process. AI tools can help automate and enhance these processes, saving time and improving code quality.

## Why Use AI for Code Review?

- **Consistency**: AI applies the same standards across all code
- **Speed**: Reviews happen in seconds rather than hours
- **Learning**: AI can explain issues and suggest improvements
- **Thoroughness**: AI can catch issues humans might miss

## Setting Up AI Code Review Tools

### GitHub Copilot and VS Code

1. Install the GitHub Copilot extension
2. Use "Explain this code" feature by selecting code and right-clicking
3. Ask for specific reviews in comments: `// Review this function for performance issues`

### Using ChatGPT for Code Review

1. Share code snippets (never sensitive code or credentials)
2. Ask specific questions like:
   - "What could be improved in this function?"
   - "Are there any security vulnerabilities in this code?"
   - "How can I make this more maintainable?"

## Effective Prompts for Code Review

When asking an AI to review your code, be specific about what you're looking for:

## Getting Started with AI Code Review

### 1. Setting Up Your Environment

Several tools are available for AI-assisted code review:

- **GitHub Copilot**: Can be used interactively to review and suggest improvements
- **ChatGPT/Claude**: Can analyze code snippets pasted into the chat
- **CodeGuru Reviewer**: Amazon's service for automated code reviews
- **DeepCode**: AI-powered static analysis tool
- **SonarQube with AI extensions**: Combines traditional static analysis with AI capabilities

### 2. Establishing a Review Framework

For effective AI code reviews, establish a framework that focuses on:

- **Correctness**: Does the code work as intended?
- **Style and conventions**: Does the code follow project standards?
- **Performance**: Are there efficiency concerns?
- **Security**: Does the code contain vulnerabilities?
- **Maintainability**: Will the code be easy to understand and modify?
