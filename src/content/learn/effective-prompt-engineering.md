# Effective Prompt Engineering for Code Generation

When working with AI assistants for code generation, the quality of your prompts directly impacts the quality of the code you receive. This guide will help you craft better prompts for more accurate and useful code suggestions.

## The Basics of Prompt Engineering

Good prompts are clear, specific, and provide enough context. Here are the key elements to include:

1. **Task description**: Clearly state what you want the AI to do
2. **Context**: Provide relevant background information
3. **Constraints**: Specify any limitations or requirements
4. **Examples**: When possible, include examples of what you want
